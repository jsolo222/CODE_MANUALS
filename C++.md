## Introduction

### What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979. It was designed as an extension of C with object-oriented programming capabilities. C++ combines the low-level efficiency of C with high-level abstractions, making it suitable for system programming, game development, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

### Why Learn C++?

C++ is valuable for:

1. **Performance**: Close to hardware, minimal runtime overhead
2. **System Programming**: Operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems
3. **Game Development**: Many game engines use C++ (Unreal, Unity)
4. **High-Performance Computing**: Scientific computing, simulations
5. **Legacy Code**: Many existing systems are written in C++
6. **Control**: Fine-grained control over memory and resources
7. **Career Opportunities**: High demand in systems, gaming, and embedded domains
8. **Modern Features**: C++11/14/17/20 add powerful modern capabilities

### Key Features

- **Multi-Paradigm**: Supports procedural, OOP, generic, and functional programming
- **Performance**: Compiled language with minimal runtime overhead
- **Memory Management**: Manual control with modern smart pointers (RAII)
- **Standard Library**: Rich STL (containers, algorithms, iterators)
- **Templates**: Generic programming capabilities
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with C
