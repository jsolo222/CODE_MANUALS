## Introduction

### What is COBOL?

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business applications. Developed in 1959, COBOL has been used extensively in enterprise systems, particularly in banking, finance, insurance, and government sectors. Despite its age, COBOL remains critical infrastructure, processing trillions of dollars in transactions daily.

### Why Learn COBOL?

COBOL is valuable for:

1. **Legacy Systems**: Maintain and modernize critical business systems
2. **Financial Sector**: Powers banking, insurance, and financial transactions
3. **Mainframe Systems**: Essential for mainframe programming
4. **High Demand**: Shortage of COBOL programmers, high-paying opportunities
5. **Stability**: Long-term career stability in maintaining legacy systems
6. **Modern Features**: Modern COBOL includes object-oriented features
7. **Business Logic**: Excellent for business data processing
8. **Critical Infrastructure**: Many mission-critical systems still use COBOL

### Key Features

- **English-Like Syntax**: Readable, self-documenting code
- **Fixed Format**: Column-based source format (free format also available)
- **Business Focus**: Designed for business data processing
- **File Processing**: Excellent file handling capabilities
- **Decimal Arithmetic**: Precise decimal calculations for financial data
- **Divisions**: Structured program organization (Identification, Environment, Data, Procedure)
- **Modern Extensions**: Object-oriented features in modern COBOL
