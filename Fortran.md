## Introduction

### What is Fortran?

Fortran (FORMula TRANslation) is a general-purpose, compiled programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. First developed in the 1950s, Fortran has evolved through many versions (FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95/2003/2008/2018) and remains one of the most important languages for high-performance computing, scientific simulations, and numerical analysis.

### Why Learn Fortran?

Fortran is valuable for:

1. **Scientific Computing**: Standard language for scientific and engineering applications
2. **High-Performance Computing**: Used in supercomputing and parallel computing
3. **Numerical Methods**: Excellent for numerical analysis and mathematical modeling
4. **Legacy Code**: Many scientific codes written in Fortran
5. **Performance**: Optimized compilers produce very fast code
6. **Parallel Computing**: Built-in support for parallel programming
7. **Academic Research**: Widely used in research institutions
8. **Career Opportunities**: High demand in scientific computing and HPC

### Key Features

- **Array Operations**: Powerful array syntax and operations
- **Numerical Precision**: Excellent support for floating-point arithmetic
- **Performance**: Highly optimized compilers
- **Parallel Computing**: Coarrays and parallel features in modern Fortran
- **Modules**: Modular programming and code organization
- **Type System**: Strong typing with modern features
- **Standards**: ISO/IEC standard (Fortran 2018 latest)
